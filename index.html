            <h1>Hi, I’m Brannen. I’m a full-stack developer and an avid problem solver.</h1>
            <p class='bio'>I’m a full-stack web developer and recent Engineering Immersion graduate from Thinkful.  Coding and solving real-world problems energize me.  I thrive on learning, utilizing new skills, and overcoming challenges.  I dive into new projects with passion and inspiring ideas. In my spare time, I’m an avid gamer who enjoys staying physically fit by grilling meats and finding the right training routines to use at the gym. I’m a fan of the backcountry and will jump at any opportunity to go backpacking, roadtripping, or simply hiking. I hope to find a team that I jive with.</p>
